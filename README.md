+# COVID-19 Patient Transcriptomics
+
+This repository contains R scripts and supporting data for reproducing analyses of transcriptomic profiles from COVID-19 patients. The workflow loads supplemental clinical and gene expression data from the associated publication, processes the tables, and generates the key figures (volcano and dot plots) illustrating differential gene expression (DGE) and pathway enrichment.
+
+## Repository structure
+
+```
+CODE/                     R scripts that implement the analysis pipeline
+  01_data_prep.R          Prepare clinical metadata, DGE results, and pathway annotations
+  02_volcano_plot.R       Build a volcano plot highlighting regulated genes
+  03_dot_plot.R           Summarize pathway-level changes in a dot plot
+DATA/                     Supplementary Excel workbooks with patient metadata and DGE tables
+PLOTS/                    Rendered figures saved as PDF files
+R/                        Cached CSV exports generated by the scripts
+project2_downloads.R      Helper script for retrieving raw data (see below)
+Project2.Rproj            RStudio project configuration
+```
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+The scripts expect an R (≥4.0) environment with the following packages:
+
+- `readxl`
+- `clusterProfiler`
+- `DOSE`
+- `org.Hs.eg.db`
+- `ggplot2`
+- `ggrepel`
+- `ggpubr`
+
+> **Tip:** `project2_downloads.R` automates the installation of CRAN and Bioconductor dependencies and downloads the required supplemental data files if they are not already present.
+
+## Reproducing the analysis
+
+1. Open the project in RStudio (Project2.Rproj) or set the working directory to the repository root.
+2. Run `CODE/01_data_prep.R` to:
+   - Import patient metadata (`DATA/mmc3.xlsx`) and DGE results (`DATA/mmc2.xlsx`).
+   - Harmonize column names and severity labels.
+   - Join genes with GO annotations and KEGG pathways.
+   - Export the intermediate CSV files to the `R/` directory.
+3. Run `CODE/02_volcano_plot.R` to create the volcano plot highlighting up- and down-regulated genes. The script writes `PLOTS/volcano.pdf`.
+4. Run `CODE/03_dot_plot.R` to calculate pathway-level summaries and render the combined dot plot saved to `PLOTS/dot.pdf`.
+
+Each script assumes the working directory is the project root (`setwd("~/Project2")`). If you clone the repository to a different path, update or remove the `setwd` calls before running the code.
+
+## Data
+
+The `DATA/` folder stores the supplemental workbooks (`mmc2.xlsx`, `mmc3.xlsx`) referenced in the original publication. The analysis does not modify these files; derived tables are written to `R/`.
+
+## Outputs
+
+- `R/DGE_results.csv` – cleaned differential expression results.
+- `R/DGE_pathways.csv` – mapping of differentially expressed genes to KEGG pathways.
+- `PLOTS/volcano.pdf` – volcano plot for the DGE comparison.
+- `PLOTS/dot.pdf` – dot plot summarizing pathway enrichment for up- and down-regulated genes.
+
+## Citation
+
+If you use this repository, please cite the original study that produced the supplemental data and acknowledge this analysis pipeline.
